TASK 6: Sales Trend Analysis Using Aggregations
What I Did

- Used **SQL Server** to analyze e-commerce sales data.
- Focused on **monthly revenue** and **order volume trends**.
- Performed data grouping by **year** and **month** using `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions.
- Used aggregate functions:
  - `SUM()` for total monthly revenue
  - `COUNT(DISTINCT Transaction ID)` for unique order count
- Sorted results to find:
  - **Monthly sales trends**
  - **Top 3 months** with highest revenue
